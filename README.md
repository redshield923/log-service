# log-service

This service will enable applications to post logs over HTTPs and provides basic visualisation of those logs in a tabulated form.

![Architecture](./docs/images/architecture.png)

The basic functionality is:

- Logs posted in to the service and stored in a database.
- Ability to view all logs, given an index name, including searching over multiple indexes
- Delete logs (Admin users only)
- Create, Update and Delete Users (Admin only)

More documentation can be found in the following files: 

- [Database](./docs/database.md)
- [CICD](./docs/cicd.md)
